In the early days of the language it was just executed on browsers and even some developers used to call it a _toy language_ but those days are long gone and now JS can do everything fronted, backend, desktop applications to mobile application and even games.

## where does JS run?

JS was originally designed to run only on browsers but in 2009 a clever engineer named _Brian Doll_ toke the open-source JS engine and embedded in a C++ program he called that program _None_, now with this we can run JS outside of a browser which means now we can build backend with JS.
